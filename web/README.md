# FrontEnd

## Create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine.

Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app  # global install of CRA
npm init react-app . --legacy-peer-deps # create CRA
	# add flag --legacy-peer-deps with npm version > 7.0
```
